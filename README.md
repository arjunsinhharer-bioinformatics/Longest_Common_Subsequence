Here is a `README.md` file that describes how to run your script and explains what it does:

# Longest Common Subsequence Finder

## Overview

This script generates two random DNA sequences and finds their **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** using **dynamic programming**. The LCS is a continuous segment of bases common to both sequences. 

The algorithm has significant applications in **bioinformatics**, such as:
- **Genomic homology detection** (finding conserved genetic elements across species).
- **Genetic counseling** (identifying hereditary mutations by comparing patient DNA with reference sequences).
- **Data deduplication** (eliminating repeating entries in datasets).

This implementation works effectively for short sequences but may slow down for sequences longer than **10,000 base pairs** due to its **O(n × m) time complexity**.

## How It Works

1. **DNA Sequence Generation**  
   - Two DNA sequences (1000–4000 bp) are randomly generated using `A`, `T`, `C`, and `G`.
   
2. **Finding the Longest Common Subsequence**  
   - The program uses **dynamic programming** to store common substrings in a **matrix (tabulation method)**.
   - When a match is found in both sequences at a given index, the matrix value is updated based on previous values.
   - The longest common subsequence is extracted from the matrix.

3. **Output**
   - The longest common subsequence between the two randomly generated DNA fragments.
   - Its length.
   - The original sequences.

## Requirements

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed along with `numpy`.

You can install dependencies using:

```sh
pip install numpy
```

## Running the Script

To run the script, execute:

```sh
python longest_common_subsequence.py
```

The output will display the longest common subsequence for **10 pairs of random DNA sequences**.

Example output:

```
The longest subsequence of ATGCTAGCGA & CTGCTAGTGC, is a 5 base-pair subsequence GCTAG
```

## Limitations & Future Improvements

- **Computational Efficiency:** The current approach works well for short sequences but **does not scale efficiently** for sequences exceeding **10,000 base pairs**.
- **Multiple Sequences:** The current implementation only compares **two** sequences. Extending it to **three or more** sequences would require significant modifications.
- **Handling Ties:** If multiple longest subsequences exist, only **one** is returned.
